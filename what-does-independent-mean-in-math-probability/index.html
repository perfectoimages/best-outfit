<p>Formula for the probability of A and B independent events. In statistics the symbol e is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 271828183. For independent events the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. It means multiply Probaility of A and B means probability of Amultiplied by probability of B.</p>

<p>Theres a couple of different formulas depending on if you have dependent events or independent events. In probability biased means that the possible outcomes are not equal in probably. So for X we could randomly pick 0 or 1 or -8532 anything we want. It means multiply Probaility of A and B means probability of Amultiplied by probability of B.
