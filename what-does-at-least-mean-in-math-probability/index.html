<p>How likely something is to happen. This complement relationship between none events and at least one events is very important and it shows up frequently in the study of probability. The union is written as A cup B or A ext or B. For instance the provability of getting at most 6 is 1 since all the possible outcomes 123456 are the required outcomes and At least 6 is 16.</p>

<p>This complement relationship between none events and at least one events is very important and it shows up frequently in the study of probability. Delta or with probability at least 1 - delta. This means that the speaker tries to arrive at the airport 25 or 3 hours before the flight leaves but certainly no later than 2 hours before the flight. You can also use at least to talk about time. This means that the probability of the event never occurring and the probability of the event occurring at least once will equal one or a 100 chance.</p>
