<p>Uniform probability can refer to a discrete probability distribution for which each outcome has the same probability. To find the probability of an inclusive event we first add the probabilities of the individual events and then subtract the probability of the two events happening at the same time. Including the endpoints of an interval. Equal probability in range ab. Its common to use commas to denote set intersection.</p>

<p>P XY P X P Y where X and Y are mutually exclusive events. One event is the complement C of another event C if the two events do not contain any of the same simple events and together they cover the entire sample space. In mathematics you would write 1 10 for a closed interval with both endpoints inclusive 1 10 for an open interval with both endpoints exclusive 1 10 includes 1 excludes 10 and 1 10 excludes 1 includes 10. For example lets say I have an object flying along the x-axis and I pin one point in the x-coordinate than the flying.
